## Freshman-Year
A few assignments and projects from my first year in NUI Galway's Computer Science and Information Technology course. The files contain code from various projects and assignments involving **C, JavaScript, HTML, CSS and jQuery**. 

As part of assignment I was required to create a Github repository to showcase code and my skills as a programmer. Please feel free to have a quick look at some of my projects.

A fun game is also attached indicative of the of television game show **Countdown**!.
